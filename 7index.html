This makes it difficult for Kuroko to operate undetected, weakening Seirin strategy.</p>
    <h3>Second Half</h3>
    <p>Kagami attempts to block Midorima shots with his incredible jumping ability. Though he able to contest some shots, Midorima skill and Takao coordination still make it challenging for Seirin to defend against Shutoku high-scoring plays.

Kagami determination to stop Midorima pushes him to jump even higher and more aggressively, effectively blocking a few of Midorima shots. This surprising move momentarily throws Shutoku off balance, allowing Seirin to close the score gap.</p>
    <h3>Final Moments</h3>
    <p>In the final moments, Seirin and Shutoku are neck-and-neck, with both teams giving their all. Midorima attempts a full-court three-pointer to secure the victory, but Kagami fierce block prevents Shutoku from scoring.The game ends in a draw, as neither team can overcome the other in the remaining time. This outcome is rare and shows that Seirin, despite being the underdog, can stand toe-to-toe with Shutoku and a member of the Generation of Miracles.</p><hr>
