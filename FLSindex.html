    <h3>First Half</h3>
    <p>From the start, Jabberwock, led by Nash Gold Jr. and Jason Silver, shows their overwhelming power and skill. Nash’s Belial Eye technique—an advanced form of Akashi’s Emperor Eye—allows him to see the whole court and predict every move, leaving Team Vorpal Swords struggling. Jason Silver uses his physical prowess to dominate Kagami and other players in the paint, scoring with powerful dunks and blocks.Even with the combined talents of the Generation of Miracles, Vorpal Swords initially struggles to counter Nash and Jason’s overwhelming presence. Nash’s ability to predict movements and control the game puts Vorpal Swords at a disadvantage. Jabberwock taunts them, further fueling the competitive fire in Kuroko and his teammates. Akashi, using his Emperor Eye, counters Nash’s Belial Eye in various plays, attempting to limit Nash’s control over the game. Kuroko utilizes his Phantom Drive and Invisible Pass techniques to support his teammates, but Jabberwock’s superior physicality and skills keep them in the lead.</p>
    <h3>Second Half</h3>
    <p>Determined to turn the game around, Kagami enters the Zone, greatly enhancing his speed, strength, and reflexes. This allows him to go head-to-head with Jason Silver, creating powerful one-on-one plays. Kagami’s Zone levels the playing field, and his intense rivalry with Jason brings a new energy to Vorpal Swords’ strategy.Kise Ryota joins the battle with Perfect Copy, replicating the skills of other Generation of Miracles members and using a mix of Aomine’s agility, Murasakibara’s strength, and Midorima’s shooting. Perfect Copy helps Kise offset Jabberwock’s lead, bringing Vorpal Swords back into the game.Vorpal Swords starts to use coordinated plays, combining Kagami’s Zone, Kise’s Perfect Copy, Akashi’s Emperor Eye, and Kuroko’s misdirection to counter Jabberwock’s superior athleticism. Their teamwork begins to overpower Jabberwock, with each player contributing their unique abilities to close the score gap.</p>
    <h3>Final Moments</h3>
    <p>Sensing Jabberwock’s lead slipping, Nash intensifies his efforts, using the Belial Eye to its full extent and rallying his teammates. He grows more ruthless, determined to crush Vorpal Swords and prove Jabberwock’s superiority. Despite the pressure, Vorpal Swords remains resilient, driven by their determination to defend Japanese basketball’s honor.Kagami reaches a new level of Zone, the “True Zone,” which allows him to elevate his entire team’s abilities. In this state, Kagami enables his teammates to reach their peak performance, amplifying their strengths and synchronizing their movements. This unity and elevated teamwork allow Vorpal Swords to overpower Jabberwock’s individual skill.In the last seconds, Kuroko and Kagami combine their skills to execute a nearly unstoppable play. Kuroko’s Misdirection Overflow distracts Jabberwock, allowing Kagami to break through their defense and score the game-winning basket.With Kagami’s final shot, Team Vorpal Swords secures the victory, defeating Jabberwock by a narrow margin. This win is not only a testament to the power of teamwork but also a symbolic triumph over arrogance and disrespect, with Vorpal Swords proving the strength of Japanese basketball.</p><hr>
